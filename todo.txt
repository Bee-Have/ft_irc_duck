OTHER :
KO- messages with bad prfix must be ignored by the server : if the prefix is not the nickname of the client
KO- empty messages must be ignored
KO- behavior issue with "check_for_cmd()" for loop is the same as doing many ifs. make it better
KO- "receive_messages()" has redundant behavior. make it better
KO- switch to Pascal case for types (classes etc)
KO- for NICK : do we use "ERR_NICKCOLLISION", if we do, how do we handle it ?
KO- comment all functions for potential teamates
KO- redundancies in server::user() command (with the substr)

QUESTIONS :
	should i have more failsafes for the USER command ?
	after using the NICK command for the first time, do all the other calls have a prefix with the current nickname ? should i take this into account ?
	does the server must give a prefix for it's answers ?
	if a client is connected to multiple channels and sends a message, is the message sent to one channel or all of them
